                <h2>Jon Pekkonen</h2>
                <h3>aka Peckoij</h3>
                <p>I was born in 1994 in Eastern Finland. My childhood and teens I lived in village called Kuortti.
                    After comprehensive school I attented general upper secondary school where I graduated with somewhat
                    average grades.
                    After that I worked in my fathers metalworkshop. In January 2014 I started my military service in
                    Finnish Defence Force.
                </p>
                <p>In Autumn 2015 I began my studies in Jyväskylä University studying physics, math and programming.
                    After year I switched to Jyväskylä university of applied sciences where I'm currently studying to
                    become Batchelor in Business Information Technology. This webpage is part of those studies with aim
                    to
                    present my skills and previous projects to future employer.

                    <h3>Language skills</h3>
                    <p>I'm native Finnish speaker and I speak and write pretty well in English.</p>
                    <h3>Programming languages</h3>
                    <p>I have previously studied and used Java and Javascipt with various frameworks, including Angular,
                        Ionic, Node.JS and React.
                        Also I handle HTML and CSS without too much trouble. Currently I'm writing my thesis about security in web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>Looking at Databases I have experience with MongoDB and MySQL.</p>

                    <p>As part of my studies I made homepage for clients product "Magic Worms".
                        Site was created in co-operation with client, Kauko Sihvonen, with his wishes and needs in mind.
                        This project gives good view to my base skills in HTML5 and CSS3.

                    <h3>Node.js and Angular7</h3>
                    <p> I created this small web-game as final assignment of web program development course.
                        Game is your classic hangman game with simple Angular frontend. Game can be played online with
                        one or more players against computer hangman.
                    </p>
                    <p>Backend is made with Node.JS and socket.io which was used for multiplayer aspect of game. UI is
                        pretty bland and boring since priority was on
                        creationg functional program and getting front and backend to work together properly.
                    </p>
                    <p>Program fullfills PWA (Progressive web application) criteria and could be added to smartphones homescreen.
                    </p>
                    <p> Game server is currently down due to low resources.

                    <h3>Git</h3>
                    <p> Using Git has become natural to me since I have used it on various projects, this site included.
                        As part of my studies I participated in group project where Git was necessary. This project
                        known as <a href="https://github.com/Peckoij/OddOgle_archive">OddOgle</a> had group of four. Two
                        programmers, content creator and marketing person.
                        For this project we used gitlab provided by JAMK. During project benefits of Git became
                        unquestionable.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>Agile development, Scrum ja Kanban</h3>
                    <p> In previously mentioned OddOgle-project our group tried out both scrum and kanban in dev work.
                        Scrum was used for first three sprints after which we chose to include parts of Kanban so
                        working would be as efficient and pleasant to everyone as possible.</p>
